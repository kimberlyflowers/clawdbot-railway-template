## Skills Built

### F: Brand Identity Generator ✅
**Location**: `/data/workspace/skills/brand-identity-generator/`  
**Tests**: 12/12 passing

#### What It Does
Conducts interview-based brand discovery using psychological profiling, extracting:
- Brand villain (what are you fighting against)
- Transformation arc (before → after identity)
- Voice & tone (Jungian archetypes)
- Positioning statement (Only formula)
- Complete brand narrative

#### Key Functions
```javascript
getInterviewQuestions()          // 16 questions across 4 pillars
analyzeBrand()                  // Psychological analysis
generateVoiceGuidelines()       // Archetype-based tone
generatePositioningStatement()  // Only formula
generateCompleteBrandStory()    // Narrative generation
mapTransformationArc()          // Before/after emotions
get2AMProblem()                 // Hidden pain point
defineAntiPersona()             // Who NOT to target
```

#### Output Example (Fitness App)
```
Villain: "Confusion and fear in beginners who are ashamed"
Archetype: Lover (connection-focused, intimate language)
Only Statement: "We are the ONLY Fitness App that combines AI with 
                 fitness AND nutrition guidance for confused beginners 
                 who are intimidated by the gym"
2 AM Problem: "Body is changing, unhappy with reflection, need to 
              change immediately"
Identity Shift: "From confused to capable of anything"
```

   has an age limit."

Q: "I don't want to go to a gym"

## Usage (Simple)

```javascript
// Step 1: Analyze brand
const brand = await F_BrandIdentity.analyzeBrand({
  interviewAnswers: {...},
  industry: 'Fitness'
});

// Step 2: Map audience
const audience = await G_AudienceIntel.generateITA({
  villain: brand.villain,
  transformation: brand.transformation,
  industry: 'Fitness'
});

// Step 3: Generate copy
const copy = await H_CopyGenerator.generateWelcomeSequence({
  persona: audience.primaryPersona.name,
  villain: brand.villain,
  transformation: brand.transformation
});

// Step 4: Deploy
await emailCampaignManager.sendSequence(copy);
```

## Key Insights (Why This Works)

1. **Psychological > Demographic**: People buy identity transformations, not products
2. **Villain Clarity**: Marketing that acknowledges the struggle wins
3. **Language Mirroring**: Using their exact words (not marketing jargon) builds trust
4. **Community Not Isolation**: Finding where they already gather (Reddit, Facebook) is cheaper than building
5. **Persona Specific**: The exact same product needs different messaging for "Confused Beginner" vs "Recovering Athlete"
6. **Day Zero Psychology**: First email is validation of struggle, not product pitch
