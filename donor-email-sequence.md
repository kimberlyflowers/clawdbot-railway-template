## EMAIL 1: THANK YOU + MONTHLY GIVING ASK
**Send Date:** Immediately  
**Subject:** Thank you for investing in our youth

Hi [Donor Name],

Thank you for showing up for our fundraiser last month—and for your generous support. We're thrilled to report that we raised $12,000, and we're already putting it to work.

But here's the thing: one fundraiser, no matter how successful, can only take us so far. Real change happens through consistent, sustained support.

**That's why we're asking you to become a monthly donor.**

Even $25/month makes a measurable difference. Recurring gifts let us plan with confidence, expand our programs, and build something that lasts. And it takes less than a minute to set up.

**Choose your level:**
- $25/month — Sponsor one student's mentoring session
- $50/month — Support a week of after-school programming  
- $100/month — Enable our newest initiative (like our coding program)

You can get started right here: **[paypal.com/youthempowerment](paypal.com/youthempowerment)**

Or reply to this email and we'll walk you through it.

Every dollar you give is a vote for a young person's future. We're grateful you're in our corner.

Best,

**Marcus Johnson**  
Executive Director

## EMAIL 2: IMPACT UPDATE + JAYLEN'S STORY
**Send Date:** 2 weeks after Email 1  
**Subject:** Meet Jaylen—and see what your support created

---

Hi [Donor Name],

I wanted to share something that's been on my heart since you supported us last month.

This semester, we've served 85 students. We launched a new after-school coding program. And one of our scholars just got accepted to a STEM scholarship program that'll change her life.

But I want to tell you about Jaylen.

Fourteen months ago, Jaylen was failing math. He wasn't connecting with school, wasn't seeing a future. Then he joined our mentorship program and was paired with one of our mentors who saw something in him.

Within weeks, something shifted. Jaylen went from struggling to understanding. From lost to engaged. And now? He's tutoring other students in math. He's become the mentor to his peers.

That transformation happened because someone—someone like you—believed in him before he believed in himself.

Your donation from last month didn't just fund a program. It created a space where a 14-year-old could find his confidence, his voice, and his purpose.

That's the impact of consistent support. That's what we're building together.

Thank you for being part of Jaylen's story—and for 84 other stories like his.

All in,

**Marcus Johnson**

## EMAIL 3: FINAL ASK + RECURRING IMPACT
**Send Date:** 3 weeks after Email 2  
**Subject:** Be the recurring force that changes lives

---

Hi [Donor Name],

After you read about Jaylen, I hope you saw what we see: one mentorship, one program, one moment of belief can ripple across a student's entire future.

Here's what keeps that going: donors like you who commit to recurring support.

Monthly giving isn't a bigger ask—it's actually better for us and for the students. It means we can hire mentors for the full year. It means we can expand programs without worrying about next month's budget. It means another Jaylen gets his shot.

**You can become a monthly supporter in less than a minute:**

- $25/month — Sponsor one student's mentoring session
- $50/month — Support a week of after-school programming  
- $100/month — Enable our coding program and STEM initiatives

**Donate here: [paypal.com/youthempowerment](paypal.com/youthempowerment)**

Or reply and we'll set it up for you.

One donation lasts a day. Monthly giving changes lives.

Thank you for believing in our students.

Best,

**Marcus Johnson**  
Executive Director
