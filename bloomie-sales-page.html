<!-- HATE CARDS --><section><h2>The 4 Things Killing Your Business That You'll Never Touch Again</h2><div><h3>📞 Cold Calling & Outbound Sales</h3><p>The rejection. The awkward silences. The "not interested" after 3 seconds.</p><p>Your AI employee now: Makes the calls. Handles the rejection. Books qualified appointments directly into your calendar.</p></div><div><h3>👻 Following Up With Leads Who Ghost</h3><p>They said "sounds great, send me more info." You sent it. Silence.</p><p>Your AI employee now: Follows up 5, 10, 15 times — across email, text, and calls. Never feels awkward.</p></div><div><h3>💬 Customer Service on Repeat</h3><p>"What are your hours?" "Do you offer refunds?" Over and over.</p><p>Your AI employee now: Handles every inquiry. 24/7.

<!-- PROBLEM SECTION --><section><h2>She Knew All Four Were Killing Her</h2><p>She left the 9-to-5 to build something of her own. Two years, maybe three, and she'd be at six figures.

She made $49K — before expenses.</p><p>They sold her the playbook — but not the team to run it.</p><div class="receipt"><h3>Her "investing in herself" receipt</h3><ul><li>Hormozi's Skool community + courses: $1,200</li><li>ClickFunnels subscription (8 months): $2,376</li><li>The coaching program she's still paying off: $5,000</li><li>Social media course + content templates: $997</li><li>Books, webinars, masterclasses, workshops: $800+</li><li>Total spent "investing in herself": $10,373+</li></ul><p>Revenue generated from all of the above: she already knew the answer.</p></div></section>
