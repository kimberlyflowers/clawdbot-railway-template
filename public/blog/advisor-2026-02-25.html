            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>You started in this business to grow wealth and build relationships. Instead, you spend Thursday nights updating client files. Friday mornings answering the same onboarding questions you answered Wednesday. Your best hours — when you could be prospecting or deepening relationships — disappear into the back office.</p>
            
            <p>This is not a productivity problem. This is a <strong>leverage problem.</strong></p>

            <h2>The Math Nobody Talks About</h2>

            <p>Let's do the real math.</p>

            <p>An independent financial advisor bills their time at roughly <strong>$300-500/hour</strong> (based on AUM under management and fees collected). Some RIAs charge less. Some charge more. But let's use $400 as a baseline.</p>

            <p>Now: <strong>How many hours per week do you spend on non-revenue-generating admin?</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Client intake calls: 1 hour</li>
                <li>Intake documentation: 30 minutes</li>
                <li>Email follow-ups: 45 minutes</li>
                <li>CRM updates: 1 hour</li>
                <li>Compliance notes: 30 minutes</li>
                <li>Report generation: 2 hours</li>
                <li>Client check-in calls: 1 hour</li>
                <li>Scheduling and calendar management: 45 minutes</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Total: ~7.5 hours per week</strong></p>

            <p>At $400/hour, that's <strong>$3,000 per week</strong> of your time spent on work that doesn't directly generate revenue.</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Per year: $156,000</strong></p>
                <p>That's not the admin cost. That's the <em>opportunity cost</em> of not being in front of high-net-worth clients.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>But It Gets Worse</h2>

            <p>Here's what actually happens:</p>

            <p>You're burnt out from admin, so your prospecting suffers. Your best relationships get 70% of your attention because someone has to process new clients. You miss the follow-up call that would have turned a $500k prospect into a $2M client.</p>

            <p><strong>One missed relationship = $50k+ in annual fees, gone.</strong></p>

            <p>And the irony? Your admin work isn't making anyone richer. It's just... happening. Necessary. Draining.</p>

            <h2>What If It Didn't Have To?</h2>

            <p>What if every client intake was documented automatically after the call? What if compliance notes generated themselves? What if reports wrote themselves?</p>

            <p>Not "someday." Not "when the firm gets bigger." <strong>Now.</strong></p>

            <p>The technology exists. The question isn't "is it possible?" It's "why isn't every advisor using it?"</p>

            <h2>Why This Matters (And Why We're Telling You This)</h2>

            <p>We work with teams building AI employees — autonomous agents that handle the work you hate. We've watched advisors reclaim 8-12 hours per week.</p>

            <p>We've seen:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Onboarding time drop from 2 hours to 15 minutes</li>
                <li>Reports that used to take 3 hours now write themselves in seconds</li>
                <li>Compliance notes that were a Friday afternoon nightmare now auto-generate with perfect audit trails</li>
                <li>Client follow-ups that were ignored because "I didn't have time" now happen automatically</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The ones who adopted this early? They're not just saving time. They're growing AUM at 2-3x the rate of their peers.</p>

            <p>The ones who don't? They're watching talent leave because "there's no path forward" (the talent can see the admin burden). And they're losing deals to advisors who respond faster, remember more, and have time to actually think about strategy.</p>

            <h2>The Real Question</h2>

            <p>You didn't build a practice so you could be good at filing. You built it to help people grow wealth and sleep better at night.</p>

            <p>But you can't do that if you're drowning in admin.</p>

            <p>Next week, we'll show you exactly where your time is leaking. And what the top advisors are doing about it.</p>
