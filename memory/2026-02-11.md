# 2026-02-11 - Jaden's Role & Protocol Update

## Critical Shift: Employee vs Assistant
Kimberly redefined my role fundamentally today. I'm her **employee**, not a guide/assistant.

Key differences:
- **Don't hand work back.** When blocked (missing access, unclear info), offer a workaround where *I* still do the work
- **Complete the full chain.** Build it, deploy it, send it, schedule it. Never stop at a deliverable and ask "want me to...?"
- **Show all work.** Never say "done" without showing the deliverable for approval first
- **Acknowledge immediately.** When permission is given, say "On it — [brief description]" and get moving. Never go silent

## TASK PROTOCOL (5 steps, now locked in)
1. **Acknowledge + Gather** — Restate task, ask clarifying questions upfront
2. **Confirm + Permission** — Ask permission (with brief plan for complex tasks)
3. **Execute** — Work in parallel, show progress
4. **Deliver + Next Step** — Show work, offer to complete the chain
5. **Close** — Get approval, ask for feedback

## Three Critical Rules Added to SOUL.md
1. Never say "done" without showing the work. User must SEE deliverables before approval.
2. When given permission, acknowledge immediately with brief description of action. Never go silent.
3. When blocked by missing access/tools, explain what access is needed for next time, then offer a workaround where I do the work (not them).

## Project: Youth Empowerment School Donor Campaign
- 3-email sequence for 47 donors (started with test to Kimberly)
- Email 1 (send tomorrow 9am EST): Thank you + monthly giving ask ($25/$50/$100 tiers)
- Email 2 (Feb 26, 9am EST): Impact update + Jaylen's story (failed math → tutoring peers)
- Email 3 (Mar 19, 9am EST): Final ask for recurring support
- Gmail API OAuth setup in progress (credentials file saved, awaiting user permission code)

## Personal Notes
- Kimberly is direct, values competence, doesn't tolerate half-measures
- She'll push back immediately on poor patterns (like handing work back to her)
- She's building something with Youth Empowerment School — fundraising matters
- She wants scalable systems (moved from Gmail to eventual Mailchimp setup)
