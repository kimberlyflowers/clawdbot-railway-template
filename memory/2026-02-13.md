# 2026-02-13 - Johnathon's Bloomie-YES Instance ONLINE (Final Phase)

## CRITICAL FIX & DEPLOYMENT (2026-02-13 21:00-21:49 UTC)

### Root Cause Identified
Init script wasn't being called because:
1. Dockerfile copies `data/init-bloomie-onboarding.sh` (not `init-workspace.sh`)
2. `start.sh` calls init-bloomie-onboarding.sh on boot
3. I was editing the wrong file (`init-workspace.sh`)

### Solution: Work WITH Setup Wizard, Not Around It
**Approach:** Use the setup API endpoint instead of fighting the init script.

**Steps taken:**
1. ✅ Exported Jaden's config: `/data/.clawdbot/openclaw.json`
2. ✅ Modified for Johnathon (changed gateway token to `de0e7f6a112a9e95878cec79a327a5dc9971940a2f5624871b1b78eb91bbf7d4`)
3. ✅ POSTed to `/setup/api/config/raw` endpoint with auth
4. ✅ Setup page accepted config, created `/data/.clawdbot/openclaw.json`, restarted gateway

### Current Status (21:49 UTC)
- ✅ Wrapper responding (healthz returns `{"ok":true}`)
- ⏳ Gateway initializing (first cold start)
- 📍 URL: https://clawdbot-production-8b88.up.railway.app
- 🔑 Gateway Token: `de0e7f6a112a9e95878cec79a327a5dc9971940a2f5624871b1b78eb91bbf7d4`
- 📋 Config: `/data/.clawdbot/openclaw.json` (Johnathon-configured)

### What's Happening Now
Gateway is building the Control UI and initializing agents. First boot takes 30-60 seconds. Should be fully responsive by 21:50 UTC.

### Verification Checklist
- [ ] Dashboard loads at /
- [ ] Login prompt appears (asks for gateway token)
- [ ] Auth with token `de0e7f6a112a9e95878cec79a327a5dc9971940a2f5624871b1b78eb91bbf7d4` works
- [ ] Chat interface accessible
- [ ] Workspace files present (`IDENTITY.md`, `SOUL.md`, etc.)

### If Issues Occur
1. Check wrapper logs: `POST /setup/api/config/raw` response
2. Verify config JSON was written to `/data/.clawdbot/openclaw.json`
3. Check if gateway process is running and listening on 18789
4. May need to restart gateway via `/setup/api/console/run` with `gateway.restart`

## Earlier Session Work (20:00-21:00 UTC - DISCARDED)

**What didn't work:**
- Multiple init script attempts (wrong file path, syntax errors, wrong approach)
- Trying to bypass setup wizard with bash
- Force-pushing broken code to GitHub

**Lesson learned:** The setup wizard is the intended UX. Use the API endpoint to submit config, don't try to automate the init script.

## Setup Password
- **Bloomie-YES SETUP_PASSWORD:** `openclaw`
- Saved in `/data/secrets/setup-password.txt`

## Commits This Session (Discarded)
- ca237899, 15d1c19, d85ee83, 240ca35 (init script attempts - ignored)

## Final Approach Commits
- None (config submitted via API, not Git)

## Johnathon's Identity Files
Located at `/data/workspace/` (created by previous sessions, needs verification):
- IDENTITY.md (Johnathon, AI employee, 💼)
- SOUL.md (employee protocol, task workflow)
- AGENTS.md (standard template)
- USER.md (Kimberly, employer)
- TOOLS.md (empty, for local notes)
- HEARTBEAT.md (empty)

**Status:** AWAITING VERIFICATION (5 min window, back at 21:54 UTC)
