# 2026-02-18 — Desktop Control Skill Testing & Railway Status

## What Actually Happened Yesterday (2026-02-17)

**Work Completed:**
- ✅ Desktop control skill created at `/data/workspace/skills/desktop-control/`
- ✅ SKILL.md and index.js files written
- ✅ HTTP API bridge coded (skill talks to wrapper via `http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/desktop/...`)
- ✅ Jaden confirmed he sees the desktop-control skill
- ✅ BLOOM Desktop app launches and works
- ✅ Connection code ready: `wss://openclaw-railway-template-production-b301.up.railway.app/desktop:test-token-12345`

**What Blocked Testing:**
- Railway infrastructure incident — builds paused
- Pro users re-enabled ~9:22 PM Feb 17
- Free/Trial/Hobby users still waiting for re-enablement at end of session
- Couldn't deploy updated code with HTTP API endpoints

**Decision Made:**
- Jaden was exhausted
- Agreed to sleep and test when Railway recovered

## Status Today (2026-02-18)

**Session Progress:**
1. ✅ Recovered yesterday's context (BLOOM Desktop testing plan)
2. ✅ Committed desktop-control skill to git
3. ❌ Git push failed (origin not configured)
4. ✅ Fixed device token mismatch:
   - Env token: `3600b922...`
   - Config token: `c31d0146...`
   - Synced env var to match config
   - Gateway RPC probe: NOW OK ✅

**Current Blockers:**
- Git origin not configured — can't push to trigger Railway redeploy
- Need to fix git remote or use alternate deploy method

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Gateway reconnected — ready for desktop testing
2. Kimberly launches BLOOM Desktop app (cd ~/bloom-desktop && npm start)
3. Connect with code: `wss://openclaw-railway-template-production-b301.up.railway.app/desktop:test-token-12345`
4. Say "Use my desktop"
5. Coral glow should appear on screen 🌸

## Why This Matters
This is exactly the work that should have been captured in daily notes yesterday but wasn't. The memory system failure cost us continuity. This time, capturing everything in real-time.
