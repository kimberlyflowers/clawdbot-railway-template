# 2026-02-18 — Desktop Control Skill Testing & Railway Status

## What Actually Happened Yesterday (2026-02-17)

**Work Completed:**
- ✅ Desktop control skill created at `/data/workspace/skills/desktop-control/`
- ✅ SKILL.md and index.js files written
- ✅ HTTP API bridge coded (skill talks to wrapper via `http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/desktop/...`)
- ✅ Jaden confirmed he sees the desktop-control skill
- ✅ BLOOM Desktop app launches and works
- ✅ Connection code ready: `wss://openclaw-railway-template-production-b301.up.railway.app/desktop:test-token-12345`

**What Blocked Testing:**
- Railway infrastructure incident — builds paused
- Pro users re-enabled ~9:22 PM Feb 17
- Free/Trial/Hobby users still waiting for re-enablement at end of session
- Couldn't deploy updated code with HTTP API endpoints

**Decision Made:**
- Jaden was exhausted
- Agreed to sleep and test when Railway recovered

## Status Today (2026-02-18)

**Current Question:** Has Railway recovered? Can we deploy now?

## Next Steps (Awaiting Confirmation)
1. Check Railway build status
2. If recovered: Deploy with HTTP API endpoints
3. Test BLOOM Desktop connection with Kimberly
4. Verify click/type/screenshot functions work

## Why This Matters
This is exactly the work that should have been captured in daily notes yesterday but wasn't. The memory system failure cost us continuity.
