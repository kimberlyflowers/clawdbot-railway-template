# 2026-02-18 — Desktop Control Skill Testing & Railway Status

## What Actually Happened Yesterday (2026-02-17)

**Work Completed:**
- ✅ Desktop control skill created at `/data/workspace/skills/desktop-control/`
- ✅ SKILL.md and index.js files written
- ✅ HTTP API bridge coded (skill talks to wrapper via `http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/desktop/...`)
- ✅ Jaden confirmed he sees the desktop-control skill
- ✅ BLOOM Desktop app launches and works
- ✅ Connection code ready: `wss://openclaw-railway-template-production-b301.up.railway.app/desktop:test-token-12345`

**What Blocked Testing:**
- Railway infrastructure incident — builds paused
- Pro users re-enabled ~9:22 PM Feb 17
- Free/Trial/Hobby users still waiting for re-enablement at end of session
- Couldn't deploy updated code with HTTP API endpoints

**Decision Made:**
- Jaden was exhausted
- Agreed to sleep and test when Railway recovered

## Status Today (2026-02-18)

**Session Progress:**
1. ✅ Recovered yesterday's context (BLOOM Desktop testing plan)
2. ✅ Committed desktop-control skill to git
3. ✅ Pushed to GitHub (triggered first redeploy)
4. ✅ Fixed device token mismatch — gateway reconnected
5. ✅ BLOOM Desktop app connected & waiting for permission
6. ✅ Rewrote desktop-control skill: HTTP → WebSocket
   - Removed HTTP API bridge requirement
   - Now sends commands directly via WebSocket
   - Skill: use_desktop, see_screen, click, type, keys
7. ✅ Committed WebSocket version & pushed to GitHub

**Next:**
- Manual redeploy on Railway (webhook may not fire)
- Then: `use_desktop` → permission request → coral glow 🌸

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Gateway reconnected — ready for desktop testing
2. Kimberly launches BLOOM Desktop app (cd ~/bloom-desktop && npm start)
3. Connect with code: `wss://openclaw-railway-template-production-b301.up.railway.app/desktop:test-token-12345`
4. Say "Use my desktop"
5. Coral glow should appear on screen 🌸

## Why This Matters
This is exactly the work that should have been captured in daily notes yesterday but wasn't. The memory system failure cost us continuity. This time, capturing everything in real-time.
